Her eldest daughter, a bright university student, began experiencing severe mental health struggles. The emotional and mental toll on the family was immense, and Nazanin made the difficult decision to leave her job as a trainee counsellor in order to care for her daughter full-time. The financial pressure quickly mounted, and with no income, she struggled to keep up with essential household expenses, leaving her scared and overwhelmed. Nazanin could also no longer afford to pay for her counsellor training, leaving her uncertain about her future work prospects. Nazanin didn’t know where to turn for help, but eventually discovered NZF through her local mosque. It was the lifeline she needed in the darkest of times. When Nazanin reached out to NZF, she found the support she desperately needed. Your Zakat helped her cover her expenses so that she could focus on her daughter’s recovery.",

The benefits he received weren’t enough to cover his expenses, and he turned to credit cards to bridge the financial gap. However, he soon fell into debt after being unable to keep up with his repayments. Living alone and lacking a support network of friends and family, Zain’s circumstances were made even more difficult by the loss of his father. The weight of his challenges pushed him to a dark place, affecting not only his physical health but also his mental well-being. When Zain found NZF, he was happy and relieved to know help was available. Your Zakat helped Zain pay off his credit card debts, buy blankets to keep warm and purchase items to help manage his gout condition.

Despite suffering from a heart condition and going through the difficulties of adapting to a new country, Ahmad was determined to pursue his dream of becoming a pharmacist in the UK. He applied for the Overseas Pharmacists Assessment Programme (OSPAP), a full-time course that qualifies international pharmacists for UK registration. However, the costs of the course and the financial strain of daily living expenses soon began mounting up. Despite working as a trainee dispenser in a local pharmacy, Mustafa’s income was barely enough to cover his living expenses. His health condition also meant he could not take on additional work. Faced with many challenges, Mustafa had no idea how to fund his course, which would allow him to become a fully qualified pharmacist and significantly increase his income. Eventually, Mustafa came across NZF and was relieved to find help to fund his course and registration fees through the Work Fund. Your Zakat helped to ease Mustafa’s financial burden and also helped to motivate him in his journey towards becoming a qualified pharmacist in the UK. He hopes to be able to help others in the future by giving Zakat to NZF once he completes his studies.",

Her low-income job and the spiralling cost of living made it impossible to make ends meet. To make matters more challenging, Shereen’s residential status barred her from accessing crucial housing benefits, and with no family and friends to turn to for help, she felt very alone and overwhelmed with her situation. Shereen found herself stuck; she could neither secure government assistance nor bridge the growing gap between her income and her mounting bills. Faced with eviction, Shereen didn’t know where to turn to for help. Thankfully, she learned about NZF at her local mosque and immediately applied to the Housing Fund for help. Her application was accepted, and she received the financial support needed to avoid eviction from her home – her only place of safety and security. Your Zakat provided a lifeline for Shereen when she needed it most.

Two years passed, and in that time, Layla and her husband welcomed their first child. But instead of enjoying their time as new parents, they struggled to make ends meet. Overwhelmed by their circumstances, they couldn’t provide the most basic necessities for their son. As new parents, they felt hopeless and almost like they had failed their son. Zakat and its power. However, when Layla and Amaad heard about NZF, they were relieved – and surprised – to know there was an organisation in the UK that could help them with Zakat. They applied to the Hardship Fund and got help towards essentials such as baby milk and food, clothing and other items. Amaad also repaid an overdue loan, alleviating him of a burden that had loomed over him for far too long. Your Zakat helped Layla and Amaad feel closer to the Muslim community and more optimistic about the future. Your support lifted their spirits and gave them some much-needed breathing at a difficult time.

Life in the women’s refuge was not without its challenges, but at least she no longer had to suffer from abuse – and her children no longer had to witness it. Saima’s youngest son has autism, and the expenses relating to the care of a special needs child soon began to add up. Saima wondered how she would ever be able to leave the shelter and start a new life on her own terms. But after securing social housing, she started to feel a glimmer of hope. Whilst she was grateful for the opportunity to have her own place, she had no furniture or appliances to make her house a home. Zakat and its power. After hearing about NZF through the shelter, Saima made an application for Zakat, which was accepted. She was so relieved to have the funds to furnish her home so that she could create a safe and comfortable environment in which to raise her children. Your Zakat supported Saima when she had nowhere to turn and served as a reminder that she was not alone in her struggle.
